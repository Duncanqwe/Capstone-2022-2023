The goal would be to provide documentation, videos, and a test platform as a training and awareness tool for cyber defenders

# APT Demonstration and Analysis (Client: Ali)

> Identify an active APT Group (Advanced Persistent Threat), research their techniques, and create a full lifecycle demonstration of all stages of the attack process.

## Why?

This would be able to train people against furture cyber defends in multiple aspects from awareness of types of attacks from theses groups to how to deal with these types of attacks

## Features/Objectives

* Users will be able to replicate environments compramised by attackers.
* They will be able to see multiple stages of the attacks
  * This would allow people to be able to be able to do the following:
    * Figure out warning signs
    * Learn how to react to attacks at different stages
    * Be able to try different countermeasures

## Constraints

* I have a general idea about what is going to go into this project but I still do not have a solid idea of what is going to be involved
